# Color PixelRL - ASU Course Project
This repo contains the angular code used to host the interactive website for our ASU course project.

## Interact with the trained model by uploading your own images!
Workflow of the current version:
- Uploading an image to the model server
- Server generates a noisy version of the image by adding guassian noise.
- Denoises the noisy image and returns to the client
- Displays all the images with a measure of PSNR
